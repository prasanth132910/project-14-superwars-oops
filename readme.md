# Object Oriented Programming in Javascript

## Milestone #4: Create a Class Player for generating a player and another Class Superwar for starting a new war.

1. Create a class for `Player` such that it contains fields like id, name, strength, image url, type and methods like `getRandomStrength()`, `view()`.
    * Use default `strength` as any number.  
    * `image` can be sequential i.e. "images/super-"+(i+1)+".png"  
    * `type` of player can alternating between hero and villain or your own logic
    ```javascript
    [
        {
            id:1,
            name:"Super Man",
            strength:100,
            img:"images/hero-1.png",
            type:"hero|villain"
        }
    ]
    ```
    * In `getRandomStrength()`, return a random strength from 1 to 100.
    * In `view()`, accumulate HTML template as below and return it.
    ```JS
    <div class="player" data-id="${players[i].id}">
        <img src="${players[i].image}">
        <div class="name">${players[i].name}</div>
        <div class="strength">${players[i].strength}</div>
    </div>
    ```

2. In class `Superwars`, loop through passed constant and  create `Player` Objects, it also has the following methods.
    * In `viewPlayers()`, display players in HTML.
    * In `buildPlayers()`, build players fragment.
